# Machine Learning Guide

## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful technology that enables computers to learn from data.
It has revolutionized many industries including healthcare, finance, and technology.

## Types of Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Examples include:
- Classification: Categorizing emails as spam or not spam
- Regression: Predicting house prices based on features

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Common techniques:
- Clustering: Grouping similar customers together
- Dimensionality reduction: Simplifying complex datasets

## Best Practices

Always split your data into training and testing sets. Use cross-validation
to ensure your model generalizes well to new data.
