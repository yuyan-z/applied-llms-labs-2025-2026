Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers 
to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. There are three main 
types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and 
reinforcement learning.

Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. 
Common applications include classification (categorizing emails as spam or not) 
and regression (predicting house prices based on features).

Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns. 
Clustering algorithms group similar data points together, while dimensionality 
reduction techniques simplify complex datasets.

Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains agents through trial and error with rewards and 
penalties. This approach powers game-playing AI and autonomous systems.
