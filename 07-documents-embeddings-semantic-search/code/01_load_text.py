LangChain: A Framework for AI Applications

LangChain is a framework for building applications with large language models.
It provides a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that make it easier
to work with LLMs in production environments.

Key Features:
- Model Abstraction: Work with different AI providers using the same interface
- Prompt Management: Create reusable, testable prompts with templates
- Document Processing: Load, split, and manage documents efficiently
- Vector Stores: Store and retrieve embeddings for semantic search
- Tools: Extend AI capabilities with custom functions and APIs
- Agents: Build AI systems that can make decisions and use tools
- Memory: Maintain conversation context across interactions

The framework is designed to be modular and composable, allowing developers
to build complex AI applications by combining simple, reusable components.

Getting Started:
Install LangChain using pip, configure your API keys, and start
building AI-powered applications with just a few lines of code.
