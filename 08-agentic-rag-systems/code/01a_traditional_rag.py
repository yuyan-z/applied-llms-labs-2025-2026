"""
Traditional RAG System

Run: python 08-agentic-rag-systems/code/01a_traditional_rag.py

This example demonstrates the traditional "always-search" RAG pattern where
the system searches documents for EVERY query, even simple ones that don't
need retrieval. Compare this to the agentic approach in 02_agentic_rag.py.

Traditional RAG Pattern:
1. User asks a question (ANY question)
2. System ALWAYS searches the vector store
3. System passes retrieved documents + question to LLM
4. LLM generates answer based on retrieved context

Problem: Searches even for "What is 2+2?" - wasting time and money!

 Try asking GitHub Copilot Chat (https://github.com/features/copilot):
- "Why does traditional RAG search for every query?"
- "What are the cost implications of always searching?"
