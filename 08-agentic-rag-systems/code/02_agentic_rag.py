"""
Agentic RAG System

Run: python 08-agentic-rag-systems/code/02_agentic_rag.py

This example demonstrates the modern agentic RAG pattern where an AI agent
intelligently decides when to search your documents vs. answering directly
from its general knowledge. Unlike traditional RAG that always searches,
agentic RAG gives your AI autonomy to determine whether retrieval is necessary.

 Try asking GitHub Copilot Chat (https://github.com/features/copilot):
- "How does the agent decide when to use the retrieval tool vs answering directly?"
- "How would I add metadata filtering to the retrieval tool?"
